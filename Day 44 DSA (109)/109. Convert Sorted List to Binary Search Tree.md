## 🧩 Problem: Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree (LeetCode 109)

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Linked List, Binary Tree, Divide & Conquer, Recursion
**Language:** C++

---

### 📄 Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert it to a **height-balanced** binary search tree (BST).
A height-balanced BST is one in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

---

### 🚀 Approach: Two-Pointer (Fast & Slow) + Recursion

* Used **slow and fast pointers** to find the middle node of the list — this becomes the **root** of the BST.
* Recursively applied the same logic to the **left half** and **right half** of the list to construct subtrees.
* Disconnected the left half by setting `slow_prev->next = nullptr`.

---

### 💡 Key Concepts

* **Middle element** of the sorted list becomes root.
* **Left of middle** forms left subtree.
* **Right of middle** forms right subtree.
* Guarantees a **balanced BST**.

---

### ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n log n)** — We traverse `n` nodes log(n) times during recursion.

### 💾 Space Complexity

* **O(log n)** — Recursion stack for balanced BST construction.

### ✅ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr) return nullptr;
        if (head->next == nullptr) return new TreeNode(head->val);
        
        ListNode* slow = head, *fast = head, *slow_prev = nullptr;
        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow_prev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(slow->val);
        slow_prev->next = nullptr;
        root->left = sortedListToBST(head);
        root->right = sortedListToBST(slow->next);
        
        return root;
    }
};
```
